I need to make some decisions regarding


TO DO:

x Set up git repo (DO THIS FIRST!)

x Add event queue (DO THIS SECOND!)
The audio generation shouldn't be done inside an interrupt. It works now, but as it gets more complex it will be a problem.
The audio callback routine should just pass the waiting audio buffer to pyAudio, and add a a task to the queue to fill the next buffer.

- Figure out sound generation strategy
Can there be recursive connections between audio modules?
I need to decide the scope of what this should be able to do. I don't want it to become so complicated that I basically reeimplement VCV Rack 
If I want that, I can just have that running and patch into it. I should look into doing that actually

- Create audio module patch interface
There needs to be a way for me to easily string together signal processing paths

- Create sequencer -> audio engine interface
This will likely end up having inputs from the global state block
There should be an object that has values that various audio modules are using as input,
and the sequencer and global state block will send outputs
